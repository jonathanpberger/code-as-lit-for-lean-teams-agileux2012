# Code Literacy for Lean Teams
## AgileUX NYC 2012
## Jonathan Berger, Pivotal Labs

# Hi!

!SLIDE
# Goals
- Argue that "Literacy" is a useful way to talk about becoming technical
- Urge people to become technically literate 
- Share how I did it


!SLIDE
## I'm @jonathanpberger
- My background is in **philosophy** and then **design** and now **development**
- I read and write code every day to make stuff at **@pivotallabs**

!SLIDE
## Who are you?
Show of hands:

!SLIDE
# Who's a primary role is Product Owner?

!SLIDE
# Who's a primary role is Designer?

!SLIDE
# Who's a primary role is Developer?

!SLIDE
# How many people have "get technical" as their NYE resolution?

!SLIDE
# How's it going? Still with it?

!SLIDE
# The Plan
- 25m to Speed through a *ton* of material.
- Try to tell my story: how I got technical, and why you might want to.
- Plenty of material to check out later. <http://jonathanpberger.com/talks/agileux>

!SLIDE
## Act 1: Coding As Literacy

!SLIDE
Learning hard technical skills is 
# scary

!SLIDE
Remember
# Literacy != Fluency

!SLIDE
# Conquer your fear!
It's fun, I promise!

!SLIDE
# A True Story

!SLIDE
## I gave a "Git for Designers" talk
- The speaker before me talked typography to a rapt audience
- ...and when Ryan said 'Git...', the room emptied(!)
- He also said:

!SLIDE
# "We don't hire designers who can't code."

!SLIDE
## Why "Code as Literacy"?
- It's a good way to talk about coding, which is often treated as a binary.
- The success of Code Year indicates this case may be stipulated. Onward!

!SLIDE
## Act 2: How does Code Literacy Affect Agile Teams?

!SLIDE
### My Thesis 
# High levels of code literacy correlate with more sustainable projects and more successful outcomes.

!SLIDE
# Where can literacy help? 
- Designer, Product Owner: better tactical design choices (remember: every choice is a design choice)
- Principal: better strategic design choices, more realistic estimates, better analytical tools.
- Developer: uhhh...

!SLIDE
# Making is good for projects
- small details are important, especially to the user. They fall by the wayside.
- there's a whole class of things for which it takes more time to explain it than to do it. This is tech literacy's sweet spot for PO's and designers.
- this leads to a *dramatic* increase in speed

!SLIDE
# Making is good for teams
- lend a helping hand around the edges
- avoid resource bottlenecks.
- tech literacy builds respect and camraderie

!SLIDE
# Designers can be fraidy-cats
- Lane: "UX designers are more scared of devs than of biz people"
- Josh / Jeff: Developers deliver code, designers deliver sketches 

!SLIDE
# Making is good for individuals
- it feels **awesome** to build things
- instead of telling someone else how to paint, you get to hold the brush

!SLIDE
# Where can literacy hurt?
- Design, PM, Principal: time / opportunity cost, overstepping bounds, loss of innocence
- Developer: tunnel vision can skew priorities

!SLIDE
## In general, more literacy is better 
(no matter what the role)

!SLIDE
# but... 

!SLIDE
never forget 
## Sometimes design is an **ineffable value-add** and code needs to take the backseat.
Preserve the ability / reserve the right to stay innocent and come up with crazy ideas that the Technically Literate deem impossible.

!SLIDE
## Act 3: How to get literate?
- Be realistic about your goals
  - A lot of promises are made to sell this stuff. Chill out.
- How I got Literate
- The links slide (later).

!SLIDE
# My Path
- re-trace my history and what I learned, in order
- what were the first things that were useful? how did I learn them?

!SLIDE
I started as 
# a self-taught designer

!SLIDE
I worked on SU and
# found Agile and fell in love. 

!SLIDE
# I wanted to bring Agile to design.

!SLIDE
I found Pivotal, and 
# they needed an Agile designer

!SLIDE
#Sweet! 
I started working with 2 pairs of developers.

!SLIDE
They would type code
# I would use Adobe for mocks


!SLIDE
Learning #1
# In-browser Mockups
with basic CSS, HTML, and a templating framework (Erb)

!SLIDE
Learning #2
# TDD and Story Writing
using Cucumber. This helped my UX and UI practice **enormously**.

!SLIDE
Learning #3
# Basic Tools
Setting up an environment, Bundler, Rake, etc., let me run locally. 

!SLIDE
Learning #4
# Git
So I could contribute small fixes, mostly copy and CSS. 

!SLIDE
# But
I was breaking a lot of tests

!SLIDE
Learning #5
# Rspec and Capybara
So I run tests and make some fixes.

!SLIDE
Now I could commit code
# **without** breaking the build
:-)

!SLIDE
Learning #6
# JQuery and the DOM
So I could make better in-browser mocks and make more changes

!SLIDE
Learning #7
# more Ruby, which led to ORMs and REST and HTTP verbs.
That's a mouthful.

!SLIDE
Learning #8
# By now, I was doing development regularly
and starting to bring my Design practice back to it. Personas in cuke!

!SLIDE
Learning #&infin;
# Still learning every day

!SLIDE
This whole time, I'd been picking up
# internet architecture.
(see Chris Dixon's list)

!SLIDE
# Meta-learnings

!SLIDE
Absolutes I Learned
## About Learning Technical Things
- Learn what the web is built of
- Immersion/osmosis is a powerful teaching tool
- Its important to **do** things, not just read about them

!SLIDE
Smells I Learned
## About Learning Technical Things
- Tools are important (but don't obsess over them)
- develop the sense of when to ask for help and when to tough it out
- develop the sense of smell of knowing when you should go along with Magic, and when you have to learn how it works under the hood

# What else?
Learn Rails! Or Sinatra.
