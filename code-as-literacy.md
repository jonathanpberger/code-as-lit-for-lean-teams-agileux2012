# Hi!

!SLIDE
# I'm @jonathanpberger


- My background is in
  - **philosophy** and then 
  - **design** and now
  - **development**
  
- I read and write code every day to build products at **@pivotallabs**

How many people have 
#&ldquo;GET TECHNICAL&rdquo; 
as their NYE resolution?

!SLIDE
# How's it going? Still with it?

!SLIDE
# Getting Technical

!SLIDE
# The Plan
- 1: "Literacy" is a useful way to discuss becoming technical

- 2: Technical literacy helps Lean Teams

- 3: Share my story about becoming literate

!SLIDE
Part 1:
# "Coding As Literacy"

!SLIDE
## Why "Coding as Literacy"?
- It's a good way to talk about coding, which is often treated as a binary.
- The success of Code Year indicates this case may be stipulated.

!SLIDE
If you work in a technical medium,
# TECHNOLOGY IS POWERFUL

!SLIDE
# BUT

!SLIDE
Learning hard technical skills is 
# SCARY

!SLIDE
Remember
# Literacy != Fluency

!SLIDE
Getting technical doesn't have to be a
# full-time commitment

!SLIDE
# A True Story

!SLIDE
## I gave a "Git for Designers" talk
- The speaker before me talked typography to a rapt audience
- ...and when Ryan said 'Git...', the room emptied(!)
- He also said:

!SLIDE
# "We don't hire designers who can't code."

!SLIDE
Part 2:
# How does Code Literacy Help Lean Teams?

!SLIDE
### My Thesis 
# High levels of code literacy correlate with more sustainable projects and more successful outcomes.

!SLIDE
# Making is good for projects
- Small details are important, especially to the user. They fall by the wayside.
- There's a whole class of things for which it takes more time to explain it than to do. 
- This is tech literacy's sweet spot for PO's and designers and leads to a *dramatic* increase in think-make-check speed.

!SLIDE
# Making is good for teams
- Lend a helping hand to development work at the edges,
- Avoid resource bottlenecks,
- Build respect and camraderie, reduce "us-vs.-them"

<!-- !SLIDE
# Designers can be fraidy-cats
- Lane: "UX designers are more scared of devs than of biz people"
- Josh / Jeff: Developers deliver code, designers deliver sketches  -->

!SLIDE
# Making is good for individuals
- Building things feels **awesome**
- "Instead of telling someone else how to paint, you get to hold the brush."

!SLIDE
Overview
# Where can literacy help? 
- Designer, PO: Better tactical design choices and execution, more team bandwidth,
- Principal: better strategic design choices, more realistic estimates, better analytical tools.
- Developer: uhhh...

!SLIDE
Overview
# Where can literacy hurt?
- Design, PM, Principal: time / opportunity cost, overstepping bounds, loss of innocence
- Developer: tunnel vision can skew priorities

!SLIDE
## In general, more literacy is better 
(no matter what the role)

!SLIDE
# but... 

!SLIDE
never forget 
## Sometimes design is an **ineffable value-add** and code needs to take the backseat.
Preserve the ability / reserve the right to stay innocent and come up with crazy ideas that the Technically Literate deem impossible.

!SLIDE
Part 3:
# Becoming literate

!SLIDE
I started as 
# a self-taught designer

!SLIDE
I worked on [Spot.Us](http://spot.us) and
# found Agile and fell in love. 

!SLIDE
# I wanted to bring Agile to design.

!SLIDE
I found Pivotal, and 
# they needed an Agile designer

!SLIDE
#Sweet! 
I started working with 2 pairs of developers.

!SLIDE
They would type code
# I would use Adobe for mocks


!SLIDE
Learning #1
# In-browser Mockups
with basic CSS, HTML, and a templating framework (Erb)

!SLIDE
Learning #2
# TDD and Story Writing
using Cucumber. This helped my UX and UI practice **enormously**.

!SLIDE
Learning #3
# Basic Tools
Setting up an environment, Bundler, Rake, etc., let me run locally. 

!SLIDE
Learning #4
# Git
So I could contribute small fixes, mostly copy and CSS. 

!SLIDE
# But
I was breaking a lot of tests

!SLIDE
Learning #5
# Rspec and Capybara
So I run tests and make some fixes.

!SLIDE
Now I could commit code
# **without** breaking the build
:-)

!SLIDE
Learning #6
# JQuery and the DOM
So I could make better in-browser mocks and make more changes

!SLIDE
Learning #7
# More Ruby, which led to ORMs and REST and HTTP verbs.
That's a mouthful.

!SLIDE
Learning #8
# By now, I was doing development regularly
and starting to bring my Design practice back to it. Personas in cuke!

!SLIDE
Learning #&infin;
# Still learning every day

!SLIDE
# Meta-learnings

!SLIDE
Rules I Learned
## About Learning Technical Things
- Learn what the web is built of (internet architecture),
- Immersion/osmosis is a powerful teaching tool,
- It's critically important to **do** things and get feedback, not just read about them.

!SLIDE
Tastes I cultivated
## About Learning Technical Things
- Tools are important (but don't obsess over them),
- Develop the sense of when to ask for help and when to tough it out,
- Develop the sense of smell of knowing when you should go along with Magic, and when you have to learn how it works under the hood.
