# Goals

urge people to become literate
urge companies to invest in their people becoming literate

# Important things
Its important to **do** things, not just read about them
tools are important (but don't obsess over them)
learning when to ask for help is important
interactivity is important
immersion is important
What the web is built of



# My Path
re-trace my history and what I learned, in order

- I started as a self-taught designer. I bought a book on photoshop, practiced a lot, and started freelancing.
- I worked on SU and found Agile and fell in love. I wanted to bring Agile to design.
- I found Pivotal. They needed an Agile designer. Sweet! I started working on Casebook.
- I learned some basic CSS and Erb / Erector so I could make in-browser mocks
- then some cucumber, so I could write stories. This helped my UX and UI practice enormously.
- then some tooling (bundler, rake) so I could run locally
- then some git, so I could contribute
- Then I learned some cucumber and rspec so I could run tests
- Then I learned about a lot more tooling and setting up a local environment
- Then I learned some JQuery and I learned about the DOM, so I could make better in-browser mocks and do some more light changes
- I was starting to pick through a lot more ruby, so I learned about REST and Databases and HTTP verbs.
- By now, I'd picked up a lot of the internet architecture.
- Then I started filling in the gaps: Rails, REST, and the rest of it.
- By now, I was doing development regularly, and starting to bring my Design practice back to it. Personas in cuke!

# GC Suggestions
- lend a helping hand around the edges
- small details are important, especially to the user. They fall by the wayside.
- avoid resource bottlenecks.
- there's a whole class of things for which it takes more time to explain it than to do it. This is tech literacy's sweet spot for PO's and designers.
- this leads to a *dramatic* increase in speed
- it feels **awesome** to build things
- instead of telling someone else how to paint, you get to hold the brush

- what were the first things that were useful? how did I learn them?

- tech literacy builds respect and camraderie
- lane: "UX designers are more scared of devs than of biz people"
- not being helpless

It's fun, I promise!
